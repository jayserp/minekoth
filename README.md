Minekoth - Minecraft TF2 Bukkit Plugin
======================================

Minekoth is an unfinished plugin written in 2013 to emulate some of the components of the game Team Fortress 2.

It includes features such as:
* Scout class - super fast
* Soldier - rocket jumping and explosive arrows
* Demo - detonatable sticky traps
* Sniper - super accurate one hit kills with scoping
* Spy - disguise as a member of the opposite team

Currently implemented gamemode is capture the point (KOTH style) only.
